      'Distributive Computing is very hard for various institutions. Using limited resources to maximize the work is very hard to achieve. Nowadays, Computers are critical part of education system.Institutions have various lab and computer system to help students perform high end task hassle free to get correct output in minimum time. Various institutions have large servers as well as high end computing system but when it comes to mass distribution among student it becomes difficult for institutions and computer to manage such large scale high performance data and users action. To overcome this issue we have created a Admin Graphical Interface (AGI) that can help both institution and computer to properly manage the user activity and store them without any errors. Using this interface we can do all sort of admin roles from creation to deletion of users, data management and security, process handling and servicing as well as many others benefits.',
